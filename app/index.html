      The SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Network is the key to a world of
      new and exciting apps where security, privacy and freedom are already
      built in. Experience the joy of storing and sharing data that only you
      control. Speak and communicate with family and friends in complete
      privacy.

    <h3 class="title">Your data is always private and secure!</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Rather than using data centres and servers, which are prone to data theft
      and shopping, the SAFE Network uses advanced P2P technology, that is
      comprised of the spare computing resources of other SAFE users.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      This crowdsourced Internet means that you, and only you, control your
      data at all times. Using SAFE apps will enable you to share data of any
      type or size on an open network not owned or controlled by anyone.

      <p class="p">
        By providing your unused computing resources to SAFE you will be paid
        in a network token, called safecoin (HYPERLINK TO SAFECOIN PAGE).
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        All that you require to do to start earning is to download the free
        SAFE software, create your account and tell the network how much space
        you are going to provide. It’s that simple! Overtime, your online
        wallet will start receive safecoin, which you can use to pay for other
        services on the network, or convert to another currency via an SAFE
        currency exchange.
