        <h3>What is SAFE Network?</h3>
        <p>
          The SAFE (Secure Access for Everyone) network can be best described as
           a fully distributed data management service. This network manages
           static and dynamic data as well as communications.
           <br><br>
           In either case the network cannot decrypt any of the data on the
           network. This can be thought of as a decentralized server that
           performs the tasks of today's httpd, ssh, scp, ftp, smtp,
           pop3, imap etc. servers.
           <br><br>
           The SAFE network is made up of unused hard drive space, CPU and
           communications capabilities of commodity computers. These computers
           are likely owned by the very users of the system, but need not be
           limited to that. Each computer will effectively mine for credits
           which can be traded for many other goods and services. These
           credits are called safecoin.
