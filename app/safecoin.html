  <h3 class="title">What is it?</h3>
  <p class="p">
    Safecoin is a digital token, it can be thought of as the oil in the engine
    of the SAFE Network, a built in way of ensuring that all users of the
    network are compensated for the value they provide. Users can create an
    account and view publicly shared content, such as SAFE websites, free of
    charge. However, users who contribute some of their unused computing
    resource, such as hard drive space, will be paid by the network for doing
    so. This space is used by the network to store the encrypted data chunks of
    other users. The amount paid is relative to the amount of data stored on
    your computer.

        <li>Users who provide some of their unused computing resource (such as hard drive space) are paid safecoin.</li>

  <p class="p">
    Safecoins earned will be automatically stored in each users digital wallet,
    where they can be spent on network services, such as to pay for storing
    data, or they can be converted into another currency via an online
    exchange. This ability to earn money from unused computing capacity is
    called farming. Users who decide not to farm can purchase safecoin if
    they still want to use network services.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    Safecoin is not yet live, but will go through implementation and testing
    shortly. As we test, we will be able to be more specific about what we
    expect each farmer to earn and how much some of the early products cost.
