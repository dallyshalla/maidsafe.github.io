  <h3 class="title">What is it?</h3>
  <p class="p">
    Safecoin is a digital token, it can be thought of as the oil in the engine of the SAFE Network, a build in wqay of ensuring that all users of the network are compensated for the value they provide. Users can create an account and view publicly shared content, such as SAFE websites, free of charge. However, users who contribute some of their unused computer resource, such as hard drive space, will be paid by the network for doing so. This space is used by the network to store the encrypted data chunks of other users. The amount paid is relative to the amount of data stored on your computer.

          <li>Safecoin is generated based on how mush the network is used.</li>
          <li>Users who provide some of their unused computing resource (such as hard drive space) are paid safecoin.</li>
          <li>Safecoin can be sold and brought via online exchanges.</li>
          <li>Safecoin can be used for buying services, such as storage.</li>

  <p class="p">
    Safecoin earned will be automatically stored in each users digital wallet, where they can be spent on network services, such as to pay storing data, or they can be converted into another currency via online exchange. This ability to earn money from unused computing capacity is called farming. users who decide not a farm can pruchase safecoin if they still want to use network services.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    Safecoin is not yet live, but will go through implementation and testing shortly. As we test, we will be able to be more specific about what we expect each farmer to earn and how much some of the early products cost.
