  <h3 class="title">What drives us</h3>
  <p class="p">
    Maidsafe's aim is to provide privacy, security and freedom to everyone on
    the planet. This has been our unwavering ambition since we started on the
    journey in 2006 and it remains our driving force today.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    Online data has become so insecure and data thefts so common place that our
    trust in companies securing our data is almost entirely eroded. An
    estimated 1.1 billion personal and sensitive records were stolen during 2014
     with 8 incidents reported every single day. A new way of managing data is
     required and MaidSafe combine several features (<a href="#">HYPERLINK</a>) that we believe
     provide security not possible using existing methods.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
    Data security not only allows us to keep or credit card details safe, or
    our medical records secure, only with security do we achieve privacy.
    Privacy is misunderstood by many. they believe that demanding privacy is
    identical to protecting secrets, or hiding something that we shouldn't be
    doing. That is some way, by not wanting to share everything with the world,
    that you are doing something you shouldn't. To us, this is not what privacy
    is about. Privacy affords us with the ability to think, explore, act and
    speak without others judging us, or our actions. It is in this environment
    in which creativity, new ideas and forms of expression flourish, unhampered
    by the oversight of society.
